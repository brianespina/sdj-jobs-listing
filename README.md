## Version 1.0.1
### 10/03/24

#### Changes
- Changed the "Hide Expired" checkbox to "Show Expired". It makes more sense to initially show only the active job postings when a user is searching for a job.
- Added a filter reset button, a quality of life improvement so users can clear all the active filters with one button, as opposed to clicking the chips one by one.

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed load more bug that causes the page number to not reset when you toggle expired checkbox
